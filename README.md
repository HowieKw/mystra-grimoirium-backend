# Final Project - Mystra Grimoirium

Mystra Grimoirium is an app that will allow users to keep track of their own grimoire for Dungeons & Dragons' spells. Users would be able to add pre-made grimoires to their list of grimoires to use as reference for spells, as well as create their own with a list of available spells. It is an app that will help keep track of spells a D&D player needs and give detailed description of what that spell does with a fun flair.

This is the frontend of Mystra Grimoirium. If you would like to see the backend, please click [here](https://github.com/HowieKw/mystra-grimoirium-frontend)


## Mystra Grimoirium API
Mystra Grimoirium API is needed in order to give the Mystra Grimoirium (frontend) the ability to:

* Login with current existing users or create a new user.
* Create a new Grimoire, and be able to create or delete spells in a grimoire.
* Be able to render all the existing grimoires and cast spell animations.
